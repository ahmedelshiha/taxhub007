## State Management Architecture

### WorkstationContext Data Flow

```
User Interaction
    ↓
Event Handler (onClick, onChange, etc.)
    ↓
WorkstationContext State Update
    ↓
localStorage Persistence (layout prefs)
    ↓
URL Query Param Persistence (filters)
    ↓
Component Re-render (memoized)
    ↓
UI Update
```

### Filter Persistence Strategy

**Storage Layers (Priority Order):**
1. **URL Query Params:** Primary source of truth for filters
   - `/admin/users?search=john&role=ADMIN&status=active`
   - Persists across page reloads
   - Shareable with other users

2. **localStorage:** Layout preferences only
   - `workstation-layout-prefs`: sidebarOpen, insightsPanelOpen
   - Provides better UX (remembers sidebar state)

3. **WorkstationContext:** In-memory state
   - Quick access during session
   - Real-time updates
